The types of CXB-loaded nanocarriers that have been developed are heterogeneous and\\nbased on polymers and lipids together or separately.

The main improvements that have been achieved are the use of cell surface ligands, the simultane-\\nous delivery of different synergistic agents, and the presence of materials that can provide imaging properties and other\\nadvanced features. The combination of CXB with other anti-inflammatory drugs and/or apoptosis inducers appears to\\nhold effective pharmacological promise.

These factors are capable of leading healthy cells to oncogenic\\npathways, assisting in disease development and progression [1, 2]. Cancer treatments involve primally surgical resec-\\ntion, radiotherapy, and cytotoxic chemotherapy [3]. However, these procedures are considered invasive to the patients,\\nwith a high impact on the quality of life and do not guarantee complete healing [4\\u20136]. Thus, extensive research is made\\nwith a focus in substances capable of inhibiting the action of oncogenic molecules, a strategy viewed as a therapeutic\\nperspective less harmful and more efficient for the treatment of patients with cancer.\\nThe cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) is an enzyme and an oncogenic molecule related to the maintenance and develop-\\nment of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) [7, 8]. It also has a pro-tumoral association in breast, gastric,\\npancreatic, and other varieties of cancer [9, 10]. COX-2 is part of an aberrant way of the arachidonic acid metabolism,\\ncatalyzing the production of prostaglandin E ( PGE ), and its pro-tumoral profile is related to an activation cascade that\\n2 2\\nleads to the formation of the chronic inflammatory component in the tumor microenvironment [9, 11]. The role of the\\nCOX-2 seems to induce tolerance and protection of the cancer cells to the immune system mechanisms [8, 12]. As such,\\nthe enzyme role in carcinogenic processes gives rise to it be considered a chemotherapeutic target.\\nCOX-2 selective inhibitors or \\\"coxibs\\\" are anti-inflammatory drugs that do not show the adverse effects associated with\\nunspecific inhibition of COX-1, where celecoxib (CXB) was the first of their kind [13]. In the light of the COX-2 association\\nwith the tumoral progression, the CXB was quickly incorporated in the adjuvant chemotherapy treatment of cancer\\n[14\\u201316], being introduced in the treatment protocols of breast and colon cancer 2 decades ago [17, 18]. It seems that\\ninhibition of PGE biosynthesis through direct inhibition of COX-2 is CXB main mechanism for tumor inhibition, possibly\\n2\\npreventing the immunosuppressive role of the prostaglandin in the tumor growth due to suppression of the Akt/ERK\\nsignaling pathways [19, 20]. Inhibition of tumor-associated angiogenesis is other mechanism discussed to came from\\nCOX-2 inhibition by CXB [21]. Moreover, CXB has shown anti-tumoral activity independent of COX [22, 23]. Induction of\\napoptosis through antagonistic effects with the antiapoptotic proteins Mcl-1 and survivin arose as a possible key aspect\\nfor COX-independent CXB activity [24].\\nMoreover, CXB has low solubility in aqueous media, low permeability, and short half-life, which requires the use of high\\ndoses for an efficient pharmacological effect [25]. In addition, it has been observed that the therapeutic doses of CXB\\ncan lead to severe adverse reactions in the cardiovascular system [26\\u201328]. Thus, CXB was withdrawn from the market by\\nthe determination of the US Food and Drug Administration in 2004 (FDA, 2004). The use of the drug was re-established\\nonly when studies showed that their adverse effects are dependant of a high dose. Currently, the CXB has a controlled\\nuse, through the patients\\u2019 cardiovascular evaluation, limiting their application in the cancer treatment [27, 29]. In this\\nway, the use of CXB-loaded nanocarriers has been idealized due to its reported ability to control the drug release and\\nthe possibility of drug targeting [30].\\nNanocarriers are colloidal dispersions able to carry different types of drugs by providing a proper media for the mol-\\necule to dissolve or adsorb, increasing their apparent bioavailability. Incorporation of drugs into nanocarriers can also\\nprotect then of the degradation or early excretion by the organism. In fact, the use of nanocarriers is considered a valid\\nstrategy in overcoming the limitation of solubility for many lipophilic drugs, such as CXB [31, 32]. There are many types\\nof nanocarriers (Fig. 1) and each one of them possesses properties that make them suitable for different uses, such as\\ncontrolled and/or sustained release, improvement of the biodistribution and the ability to cross the blood\\u2013brain barrier\\n[33\\u201335].\\nRegarding the use of nanotechnology on the treatment of cancer, it has been observed that nanocarriers have an\\nadvantage in infiltrating and remain in the tumoral microenvironment exploiting tumor-induced angiogenesis, in an\\nenhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect [36]. Although the EPR effect does not show the same effectivity on\\nin vivo evaluations and on clinical trials [37], it is relevant in augmenting the site-specific accumulation of the drug\\ncompared to other approaches [38].\\nIn this context, it was expected that the use of CXB-loaded nanocarriers could be evaluated for the treatment of dif-\\nferent types of cancer. Thus, the goal of this study was to review the formulations of CXB-loaded nanocarriers developed\\nin the last decade and the most recent advances in this perspective (2011\\u20132024), focusing on their morphological and\\nphysicochemical properties. Also, it was tried to trace the improvement of the systems developed and the future per-\\nspectives for the subject.\\nVol:.(1234567890)\\nDiscover Nano (2024) 19:142 | https://doi.org/10.1186/s11671-024-04070-0 Review\\nFig. 1 Schematic representation of nanocarriers reported in the literature associated with CXB\\n2 Data collection\\nFor this study, only original research manuscripts published since 2011 until 27 April 2024, indexed at PubMed, Web of\\nScience, and Scopus databases, were considered. The search for the manuscript was based on the use of the terms \\\"COX-\\n2; nanotechnology; cancer; COX-2 inhibitor, celecoxib; and nanocarriers\\\" in different combinations. Also, the references\\nof the selected original manuscripts were checked.\\nArticles that showed significant conflicts of interest or results without statistical data have been disregarded. Common\\ncharacteristics of nanocarriers formulations such as long-term stability, biocompatibility, and CXB loading capacity, had\\nto be reported for the inclusion of the study in this review. Technical elements of the studies were recorded such as year\\nof publication; targeted tumor type; pharmaceutical target; route of administration; and the stage of development of the\\nnanocarrier. Also, the methods of obtention of the nanocarriers; main components; the presence of co-encapsulation;\\nand the main results of the studies were here noted.\\n3 Results and discussion\\n3.1 Data processing\\nThe articles were selected based on inclusion and exclusion criteria using the guidelines of acquisition protocol PRISMA\\n(Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and meta-analyses) (Fig. 2). The search was able to identify 356 articles\\nfor the subsequent analyses. The exclusion of the repeated studies and those which are not under the inclusion criteria\\ngenerated a list of 58 eligible manuscripts for this review.\\nThe use of CXB-loaded into nanocarriers in the context of cancer is recent, and growth in the number of studies in the\\nsubject starting in 2016 and peaking in 2019 (Fig. 3). The reduced number of publications between 2020 and 2022 can\\nbe related in the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in both scientific activity and publications [39]. However, it seems\\nthat pre-pandemic levels are returning with a rise of publications in 2023. At the time of writing this review, two more\\npapers were published in 2024.\\nVol.:(0123456789)\\nReview Discover Nano (2024) 19:142 | https://doi.org/10.1186/s11671-024-04070-0\\nFig. 2 Scheme of the screening employed to select the manuscripts used in this review\\nFig. 3 Published studies\\n(2011\\u20132024) on the subject\\nof CXB-loaded nanocarrier.\\nReview process occurred until\\nApril/2024\\nVol:.(1234567890)\\nDiscover Nano (2024) 19:142 | https://doi.org/10.1186/s11671-024-04070-0 Review\\nAmong these studies there were no clinical trials, which indicates that no current studies are applying CXB-loaded\\nnanocarriers in the treatment of cancer. Thus, all the studies in this review are in the pre-formulation and pre-clinical\\nphases. Therefore, it is important to notice that there were 253 studies on the use of celecoxib for the treatment of cancer\\napplied in the clincaltrials.gov database, despite not directly employing a nanosized delivery system.\\nIn vivo studies were performed in 54% of the selected manuscripts, becoming more common since 2017 (Table 1).\\nArticles that contain only in vitro assays correspond to 43%, with a remarkable presence in the first 5 years (Table 1). Two\\narticles only showed the pre-formulation studies, without any in vitro or in vivo test. This scenario underlines the fact\\nthat research into the use of CXB-loaded nanocarriers is still in its infancy.\\nSixteen studies (28%) showed CXB-loaded nanocarriers targeting different tumor types, thus revealing the potential\\nversatility of the CXB in cancer protocols due to COX-2 participation in many cancer types. On the other hand, it is already\\npossible to observe a trend when looking into the data: (1) there is the remarkable presence of carriers developed for\\nbreast cancer (14 studies, 24%); (2) almost half of the papers used an intravenous (i.v.) approach (28 studies), and (3) with\\na focus on the cytotoxic action of the drug in the tumor cells (41 studies, 70%).\\nThese facts do not hide that the use of CXB-loaded nanocarriers also is observed in alternatives ways of chemotherapy,\\nsuch as in the overall model of application or in the direct use of the CXB, where the intended role of CXB-loaded sys-\\ntems is summarized in Fig. 4. Wu et al., (2017), Liu et al., (2019), and Zhang et al., (2019) developed formulations in a way\\nthat they act in chemo-resistant tumor cells [56, 67, 71]. Yen et al., (2016) produced formulations targeting susceptible\\nnormal cells in a preventive perspective to patients in the risk group of oral cancer [53]. At least fifteen studies proposed\\nthe modulation or destruction of components of the tumor microenvironment (26%), from which 11 studies acknowl-\\nedged that the immunomodulation could contribute to the inhibition of the tumoral cells [66, 71, 74, 78, 82, 84, 87\\u201389,\\n94, 95]. In fact, it seems that there is a growing understanding that the potential of CXB in cancer treatment protocols\\nlies in the sensibilization of the tumor to the cytotoxic approaches, providing an immunosupportive tumor-associated\\nmicroenvironment through COX-2 inhibition. Studies that focused the CXB component into the inhibition of COX-2 on\\nthe microenvironment corresponded to 45% of the papers published since 2020.\\n3.2 Nanocarriers\\nNanocarriers are one of the main perspectives for the optimization of CXB use in cancer therapeutics. In this review,\\nthe formulations observed can be majorly classified as polymeric-based or lipid-based formulations (Fig. 5.). In a lower\\namount, there are also reports on hybrid nanoparticles and nanocomposites.\\nFrom Fig. 5, it can be inferred that the development of CXB-loaded nanocarriers does not deviate from most tradi-\\ntional formulation perspectives [96]. As an example, the poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA), a common polymer for drug\\ndelivery systems, had a remarkable presence, being used in 6 of 8 nanosphere nanoparticles.\\nThe PLGA is a biopolymer, biocompatible, composed of lactic acid and glycolic acid monomers, that are degraded by\\nthe organism due to its carbohydrate-derived components being metabolized by the Krebs cycle [97]. Use of PLGA is also\\nboosted by the possibility of surface modifications such as PEGylation or immune-targeting. This polymer can also be\\nused to entrap hydrophobic drugs such as CXB through a variety of techniques such as nanoprecipitation, emulsification-\\nsolvent evaporation and spray-drying. The drug is easily incorporated through solubilization in a suitable organic solvent,\\nsuch as acetone, alongside the polymer, which is them mixed with an aqueous phase, with the organic solvent being\\nlater removed through evaporation [33, 98]. Usage of surfactant seems to have improved CXB entrapment efficiency\\ninto PLGA nanoparticles [40, 48, 50, 52].\\nFrom the perspective of the improving biopharmaceutical and pharmacokinetic properties of CXB, Kim et al., (2011)\\nand Vera et al., (2014) produced CXB-loaded PLGA nanospheres targeting gliomas. Kim et al. revealed the capacity of the\\nnanoparticles to promote the cytotoxicity of CXB in a similar manner as the free drug [40], and Vera et al. showed that\\nthe cytotoxicity of the nanoencapsulated CXB is concentration-dependent. In addition, the potential use of polysorbate\\n80 as a permeation enhancer for the blood\\u2013brain barrier has also been reported [50]. Liu et al., (2024) used the known\\nproperties of PLGA to load CXB while coating the system with a C166 cell line membrane to ensure white blood cell\\nadhesion and preferential delivery to the tumor site [94].\\nOn the range of lipid-based systems, vesicular structures (18 formulations), mainly liposomes (10 formulations),\\nwere majorly studied (Fig. 4b). The liposomes used for CXB incorporation were based on the use of phosphatidylcho-\\nline and cholesterol. Liposome\\u2019s structure, as seem in Fig. 1, is composed of a hydrophilic core and an amphiphilic\\nbilayer membrane containing phospholipids and structural lipids. While hydrophilic molecules can be dispersed in the\\nVol.:(0123456789)\\nReview Discover Nano (2024) 19:142 |

CXB can be conjugated with phospholipid to gen-\\nerate nano-sized liposomes. After intravenous administration, the system focuses on tumor tissues. Then, the liposome is internalized by\\ntumor cells with subsequent lysosomal scape and CXB release. CXB can control chronic inflammation and prevent the accumulation of\\nimmune cells, cytokines and prostaglandins after direct COX-2 inhibition COX-2. In addition, CXB may induce release of proapoptotic factors\\nby a COX-2 independent mechanism resulting in cellular apoptosis\\nFig. 5 Profile of the CBX-loaded nanocarriers over their general classification based on the major component and distribution of the types\\nof polymeric particles, lipid-based formulations and nanocomposites particles. *NLC: nanostructured lipidic nanocarrier\\nVol:.(1234567890)\\nDiscover Nano (2024) 19:142 | https://doi.org/10.1186/s11671-024-04070-0 Review\\ncore, hydrophobic drugs such as CXB are incorporated into the bilayer, alongside the lipophilic tails of the phospholip-\\nids and cholesterol. The liposomes can be obtained through methods such as lipid film hydration, the most common\\nin the screened papers, and ethanol injection [99]. The CXB is incorporated by dissolution into organic solvents during\\nthe process. Following in the footsteps of the Doxil\\u00ae, the use of polyethylene glycol (PEG) was reported for 9 out of\\n10 of the developed liposomes [45, 49, 51, 54, 55, 60, 62, 69, 88]. This factor was expected due to the knowledge of\\nthe stealthiness provided by this polymer when onto the surface of the nanocarriers [100\\u2013102].\\nOther type of vesicles applied for CXB loading were ethosomes, transfersomes [42], cubosomes [87], transetho-\\nsomes [90], and niosomes [91]. For these formulations, there was a remarkable presence of surfactants such as Span\\u00ae\\n60, Poloxamer\\u00ae 407 and Tween\\u00ae 20, aiming for a improved formulation stability for topical administration [42, 87, 90]\\nin possible subsequent in vivo and clinical studies.\\nHybrids between lipid and polymeric particles, assigned as nanocapsules or just nanoparticles, were also relevant\\namong the screened papers. These systems were characterized by multilayers with a oily core such as palmitic acid\\n[93] a phospholipid emulsion [31, 35, 57, 58] or liposome [68]. The core would them present one or more polymeric\\ncoatings with multipurpose functions including structural and controlled release purposes, such as usage of prota-\\nmine [31, 35] and chondroitin sulfate [57, 58], targeting components such as hyaluronic acid for CD44 recognition\\n[31, 68, 93], or theranostics purposes with lactoferrin [57] or gelatin [58] conjugated with quantum dots.\\nIn the main formulations analyzed in this report, no negative interactions between CXB and the common nano-\\ncarrier components were detected, indicating that the drug is well suited for transport with standard methods and\\nreagents. On the other hand, most of the techniques used required the use of organic solvents to dissolve CXB,\\nincluding chloroform and methanol. While this is a necessary step due to the hydrophobic nature of the drug, it can\\nbe a bottleneck in the purification processes of the nanocarrier for clinical use. Therefore, the use of safer solvents\\nsuch as ethanol is recommended.\\n3.3 Approaches to enhance CXB therapeutic efficiency\\n3.3.1 Targeting\\nTo develop efficient nanocarriers different approaches were used. Most of them were based on the use of specific\\nmolecules on their surface. Initially, it was tried to overcome the well-known negative sides of PEGylation in both\\nliposomal and polymeric systems, such as the reduced effectivity after the first dose because of antigenic recognition\\n[103], and the decrease of the absorption capacity and endosomal escape in the target cells [104]. As such, all the\\nsystems in this topic intended to confer additional qualities to the traditional designed systems through innovative\\nsurface modifications.\\nInitially, Ju et al. (2014) used the transduction domain peptide of HIV-1 protein (PTD ) linked to the PEG chains of\\nHIV-1\\na liposome. This addition showed the enhancement of the cell recognition and permeation of the formulation and also\\nprovided a better entry into the nucleus, which is a intracellular target of epirubicin, co-encapsulated with the CXB in\\nthe study [49].\\nAnother protein-based approach was used by Limasale et al., (2015), who branched an antibody against the epidermal\\ngrowth factor receptor (EGFR) on the surface of liposomes, due to the hypothesis that cancer cells overexpress EGFR on\\ntheir surface. The immunenanoliposome, as it was called, showed cytotoxicity against colon (HCT-116, SW620 and HT-29)\\nand breast cancer (MDA-MB-468) cell lines. This effect was similar to the one observed by the free CXB and greater than\\nnon-immunogenic liposomes [51]. It is interesting to observe that in a previous study published by the same research\\ngroup, the liposomes used as a control showed cytotoxicity against the same colon cancer cell lines [45], which are not\\nobserved in the latter study.\\nTwo nanocapsules developed by Abdelhamid et al. in parallel works also had unique targeting mechanisms In one\\nof the studies, a particle was developed as an emulsion enveloped by a layer of chondroitin sulfate (CS) and a layer of\\nlactoferrin that are carrying CXB and honokiol (Abdelhamid et al. 2018a). The particle developed in the second study has\\na layer of gelatin type A replacing the lactoferrin and are co-encapsulated with rapamycin (Abdelhamid et al. 2018b). The\\nfirst study proposed that the recognition of the lactoferrin and the CS by CD44 induced greater uptake of the particle\\nand, inside the endosome, initialized a gradual release of the drugs. In the second study, gelatin acted as a protection\\nof the nanocapsule in the bloodstream, and its degradation by the metalloproteinases, overexpressed in breast cancer\\nVol.:(0123456789)\\nReview Discover Nano (2024) 19:142 | https://doi.org/10.1186/s11671-024-04070-0\\ncells, allowed the endocytosis of the nanocarrier by the uptake promoted by the CS [57, 58]. Similar perspective pro-\\nmoted the coating of Sun et al. (2019) liposome and Lee et al. chitosan nanoparticle in hyaluronic acid, aiming for its\\nCD44 recognition [68, 78]. Kaur et al. also applied this concept, but instead by developing hyaluronic acid conjugated\\nto alendronate nanoparticles [93].\\n3.3.2 Theranostics\\nThe previously mentioned studies from of Abdelhamid et al. discern from each other by the presence of quantum dots of\\ncadmium-tellurite in the nanocapsule. Quantum dots are components with high fluorescent capacity and easy detection,\\nhaving as main application the capacity to generate traceable particles with imaging and diagnostic function [105]. Thus,\\nthe authors approached in their studies the theranostic capacity of their CXB-loaded nanocarriers: in the same time that\\nthe therapeutic action is provided by the tumor-specific cytotoxicity, induced by the selective and facilitated cell uptake,\\nthe quantum dots presence allowed the observation or detection in the tumor site [57, 58].\\nTheranostic nanocarriers were also idealized by O\\u2019hanlon et al. (2012) and S. K Patel et al. (2013), who were in the same\\nresearch group. In this case, nanoemulsions were developed with a perfluoropolyether core which has the isotope F 19 of\\nfluorine. Also, a near-infrared dye (NIR dye) was co-encapsulated with the CXB. The nanocarrier accumulation in the tumor\\nwould allow the production of an image through nuclear magnetic resonance with the PFPE or through fluorescence\\nusing the NIR. Therefore, it is important to notice that the studies focused on different targets, first, tumor cells [44], and,\\nsecond tumor-adjacent macrophages [47].\\n3.3.3 Controlled release mechanisms\\nIn their studies, Abdelhamid et al. also attributed the increase of the carrier uptake and selective drug-release mechanisms\\nby the addition of a layer of lactoferrin\\u2014recognized by CD44 in the tumor cell surface\\u2014or gelatin\\u2014recognized by cell\\nsurface metalloproteinases, both overexpressed in the surface of the tumor cells [51, 52]. Huang et al. (2019) also sought\\nto explore the surface metalloproteinases of tumor cells using a peptide susceptible to degradation by these enzymes\\nin a triblock system with PEG and poly(\\u03b5-caprolactone). A nanosphere was developed and engineered in a way to have\\namphiphilic characteristics. Their hypothesis was based on the idea that the degradation of the peptide would lead a CXB\\nrelease from the nanocarrier to the tumor microenvironment [66]. Similar perspective was employed by Cai et al. (2024)\\nfor multi-modal combined therapy, with CXB acting as an anti-inflammatory also towards microenvironment modula-\\ntion. The drug was incorporated in the outermost layer of a complex nanosphere system, and associated to gelatin for\\nmetalloproteinases-associated release [95].\\nOthers authors employed pH-induced release, such as Cao et al. (2023). By complexing CXB with Poly-L-arginine\\narranged in micelles, it was expected that the acidic environment of the tumor microenvironment would promote\\nthe drug release and subsequent inhibition of the COX-2 related immunosuppressive profile [89]. This hypothesis was\\nconfirmed with the formulation containing co-loaded CXB presenting higher tumor suppression in vivo, related to\\nsensibilization for the cytotoxic treatment. This highlighting that multiple coatings are not needed to achieve microen-\\nvironment pH-mediated CXB release. Wu et al. (2017) and Zhang et al. (2019) also obtained nanoparticles susceptible to\\npH response for controlled drug release. Wu et al., observed that the release was achieved by the increased solubility of\\ncalcium carbonate and calcium phosphate of the nanocomposite in the acidic pH of the tumor cells and the endosomes\\n[56]. While Zhang et al. reported the presence of a tertiary amine group, which enabled the release of the drug in the\\nacidic environment of the endosome. This work also showed a joint release mechanism, based on the susceptibility of\\nthe disulfide linkage in the nanocarrier to the control of redox in the cell fulfilled from the glutathione (GSH) [71]. Another\\nstudy that exploited release through susceptibility to redox using a disulfide linkage was performed by Liu et al. (2019). It\\nis interesting to note that the three above described studies are targeting the reversion of the mechanism of resistance\\nof the tumor cells against the drugs, with a major priority in control and selective release, dependant on the tumor cells\\u2019\\nresponse to the adsorption of the carrier [56, 67, 71].\\n3.3.4 Excipient choice\\nSome types of tumor target have an urge for specifics approaches, usually related to their primary location in the body.\\nCXB-loaded nanocarriers targeting lung and various skin cancers are examples of systems designed with special attention\\nVol:.(1234567890)\\nDiscover Nano (2024) 19:142 | https://doi.org/10.1186/s11671-024-04070-0 Review\\nto the target location. Lung cancer is the most prevalent cancer type in the world [3] and nanocarriers whose targeted\\nsite is in the lung have a preference for administration through inhalation. In the works of Emami et al. (2015) and Said-\\nElbahr et al. (2016), it is possible to observe the ability of PLGA nanoparticles to deliver CXB through inhalation when\\nthey are associated to an adequate content of surfactant.\\nEmami et al. (2015) used the Taguchi method for the development of an optimized CXB-loaded nanocarrier with\\nPLGA. The polymer was associated with poly(vinyl alcohol) as a surfactant to try to obtain a more uniform particle size\\ndistribution. Therefore, it was detected that the particle has instability by spray administration, so the authors inoculated\\nit in a microparticle of lactose, in a system called \\\"nano-in-micro\\\". The lactose particles were able to release the intact\\nnanocarrier to continue its course [48].\\nThe PLGA nanoparticle developed by Said-Elbahr et al. (2016) was produced with poloxamer 188 to increase the sta-\\nbility and enhance absorption. The authors demonstrated in vivo that the obtained nanosphere has good inoculation\\nthrough the Air Jet nebulization method, with high lung accumulation and relevant presence in metastatic tumor sites\\nof lung cancer, although this indicates reduced site-specific selectivity [52].\\n3.4 Co\\u2011loading of CXB with other drugs\\n3.4.1 Targeting breast cancer\\nCertain types of cancer received more attention in health concerns because of their prevalence and group risks, as the\\nbreast cancer, with high prevalence among women and associated with relevant hereditary characteristics, who justified\\na robust investment in novel effective and less harmful therapeutics [3]. The work of Ju et al. (2014) revealed that it is\\npossible to have an interesting niche for CXB-loaded nanocarriers in this cancer type through targeting of vasculogenic\\nmimicry channels. These pro-tumor segments were recently discovered, and their production seems to be related with\\na tumor-induced angiogenesis, since they are observed in processes of breast cancer relapse and metastasis [49, 106].\\nA PEGylated liposome loaded with CXB and epirubicin was produced and the authors inferred that the exploitation of\\nthe EPR effect, greater circulation time, increased permeation of the PTD peptide, and synergic effect between the\\nHIV-1\\ndrugs could explain the better results found in vitro and in vivo when compared to the free drugs. It was observed the\\nreversibility of the epirubicin resistance in the epirubicin-resistant cell lines, high CXB-dependant cytotoxicity against\\nthe formed channels cells, as well as a decrease in the invasive cell capacity [49].\\nThe synergy between the dependant and independent of COX-2 CXB anti-cancer effects, and co-loaded drugs is one of\\nthe most effective and promissory strategies in the analyzed studies. The CXB mechanisms of action are capable of help\\nor being helped by other drugs who act crosswise in the various metabolic ways affected by the COX-2 inhibitor [35, 54,\\n65, 68, 71, 78, 80]. It was frequently observed that drugs with anti-inflammatory effects and/or apoptosis inductors have\\nexcellent synergic effects when associated with the CXB, mainly when altering the modulation of TNF\\u03b1, NF-\\u03baB, and STAT3.\\nIn the work of Sun et al. (2019) a CXB and curcumin-loaded nanocapsule was developed aiming the suppression of\\nthe metastatic process in breast cancer. The carrier has the cell-penetrating peptide (TAT) linked with the NF-\\u03baB essential\\nmodulator (NEMO)-binding domain peptide (NBD) and demonstrate action in inhibition of pro-tumoral inflammatory\\ncomponents in the tumor microenvironment, responsible for the important process of invasion and metastasis. The\\ninhibition by these combined drugs focused on the action of the NF-\\u03baB factor showed good results in vitro and in vivo.\\nThe study demonstrates that the proprieties of the curcumin allied with the anti-inflammatory and anti-tumoral effects\\nof the CXB were able to revert the expression of inflammatory factors by the tumor and to induce significant cytotoxicity\\ndecreasing the migration capacity by the invasive cells [68].\\nAnother study focused on the inhibition of the metastatic process on breast cancer was realized by Yu et al. (2018).\\nThey developed a PEGylated nanosphere loaded with CXB and Brefeldin A. This nanocarrier showed promising\\nresults once it inhibited the tumoral growth and invasion capacity by a synergic regulation of the Golgi apparatus\\nin mice [64].\\nThe last two mentioned studies exemplify a trend observed through the analysis of the selected articles: a wide range\\nof drugs are being studied due to similar or crossed pharmacodynamics with the CXB. In addition, a distinction can be\\nmade by strategies that (i) exploit the modulation provided by the CXB and (ii) evaluated the use of new molecules for\\ncancer therapeutic protocols. At the moment, only the use of traditional drugs have robust literature support for safety\\nuse, novel molecules are showed as alternative perspectives for a late exploration after greater coverage.\\nVol.:(0123456789)\\nReview Discover Nano (2024) 19:142 | https://doi.org/10.1186/s11671-024-04070-0\\n3.4.2 Synergy between the CXB and established chemotherapeutic drugs\\nAmong established drug, it was observed the use of epirubicin and the doxorubicin between the different drugs co-\\nloaded with the CXB in the developed nanocarriers. The doxorubicin (DOX) is an anthracycline that acts by inhibition of\\nthe replication and transcription of DNA by genome biding, being largely used in cancer therapy. The DOX has liposomal\\nformulation commercially available and several ongoing clinical trials for new products [61, 65, 107]. The epirubicin is\\nalso an anthracycline used mostly as an adjuvant in chemotherapy of breast cancer, however, it is observed that invasive\\ncells of this type of cancer acquire resistance to this drug [49].\\nDOX was the chosen drug for co-loading in four novel polymeric particles developed by [67, 71, 78, 80]. These studies\\nexploited the ability of CXB to apparently revert the DOX resistance by the tumor cells. The combined mechanisms of\\naction of the drugs and the use of selective release mechanisms showed a significant effect in the sensibility of tumor\\ncells to the treatment. It was observed the effects of apoptosis induction, inhibition of recidivist carcinogenesis pathways,\\ntumor expansion, and in vivo greater reduction of tumor volume. DOX was also applied in combination therapy with\\nCXB-containing nanocarriers in different regimens of administration, aiming for optimal use of the modulation of the\\ntumor microenvironment by the coxib [74, 75, 84].\\nPreviously mentioned formulations of Cao et al. [89] and Cai et al. [95] also employed DOX as the cytotoxic chemo-\\ntherapeutic. In an interesting perspective, Cao et al. incorporated a plasmid for IL-12 into their micelles, producing\\nmicelleplexes, aiming for gene modulation to contribute into the immune modulation and potentialize the CXB effects,\\ntriggering a tumor-repressive cascade. The potential of genetic therapy is well-know, but clinical results are still in need.\\nCai et al. on other hand aimed for a multi-modal therapeutic approach, with CXB-induced immunomodulation, and\\ncombined effects of photothermal and photodynamic therapies and DOX for intracellular action against induced murine\\ncervical carcinoma (U14 cell line).\\nHuang et al., (2019) tested the synergy between the CXB and the paclitaxel (PTX). The PTX is one of the most employed\\ndrugs in cancer adjuvant therapy\\u2014it has a mitosis inhibitor effect. The study observed that CBX, as an anti-inflammatory\\nin the microenvironment and tumor cells, helped in the chemotherapeutic action of PTX, suppressing chemoresistance\\nmechanisms like the activation of anti-apoptosis factors. Interesting results in vitro and in vivo were showed. The in vitro\\ntests displayed a significant tumor cell line inhibition by the reduction of exogenous PGE ; while the in vivo experiments\\n2\\nrevealed a reduction of the tumor volume with an increase in the survival rate. Additionally, no significant mass reduction\\nin the mice treated with the nanoparticles was observed when compared with the free drugs [66].\\nLetrozole (LTZ), used by Elzoghby et al. in two studies, is also a drug used in breast cancer treatment protocols, mainly\\nwith women in postmenopausal. As an aromatase inhibitor it was expected that LTZ would have a synergic effect with the\\nCXB since the targeted enzyme has shown stimulus hormone-dependant by COX-2 in breast cancer. The authors sought\\nto develop nanoparticles able to exploit this synergy and the resistance reversion induced by the CXB. The promising\\nresults in both studies encourage the addition of CXB in cancer therapeutic protocols as an antitumor modulator [31, 35].\\n3.4.3 Synergy between the CXB and non\\u2011established chemotherapeutic drugs\\nIn terms of novel drug alternatives, it is natural that co-loading another substance with the CXB will lead to other hydro-\\nphobic drugs. The brefeldin A used by Yu et al. (2018) is a lactone of fungal origin with very poor aqueous medium solubil-\\nity [64]. Another fungal origin lactone used was the rapamycin (RAP). It\\u2019s estimated that the inhibition of the mammalian\\ntarget of rapamycin (mTOR) possess decisive antitumor characteristics, but the RAP high hydrophobicity was a limiting\\nto use. Co-loading in a nanocapsule with the CXB showed notable synergic antitumor characteristics [58].\\nThe use of drugs obtained by a natural perspective, such as the brefeldin A and the rapamycin, are well established\\nand important alternatives for the discovery of new active principles and the development of new drugs. These novel\\ndrugs can also benefit or increase the antitumor characteristics of the CXB. Furthermore, these substances also have a\\npoor hydrosolubility and toxicity to healthy cells, thus they can profit from an administration who guarantees selectivity\\nand good bioavailability.\\nOne of these substances, the diosmin are a high hydrophobic drug commonly used as an anticoagulant. The drug\\nwas shown capable of modulating the expression of molecules relevant to the hepatocellular carcinoma context in a\\ncrossway with the CXB, confirming the synergic interaction by both drugs [59]. Similar results are founded by co-loading\\nof CXB and the hydrophobic compound honokiol, with strong apoptosis induction in vitro and in vivo targeting breast\\ncancer cells [57].\\nVol:.(1234567890)\\nDiscover Nano (2024) 19:142 | https://doi.org/10.1186/s11671-024-04070-0 Review\\nThe plumbagin and the genistein are two phytochemicals who also are co-loaded with CXB in studies selected for\\nthat review. The plumbagin is a toxin capable of provoking critical alterations in the genome with a high risk tied to its\\nuse [54]. In fact, in the study of Gowda et al., although synergic antitumor effect with the CXB has noted, non-specific\\ntoxicity dependant of plumbagin was also observed, so that methods to include greater tumor selectivity are necessary\\nfor possible use.\\nGenistein is an isoflavone capable to connect in estrogens receptors and has the capacity of inhibition of GLUT1 chan-\\nnels, an important perspective for prostate cancer. Moreover, in the study realized by Tian et al., the synergic effect with\\nthe CXB induced stress in the antioxidant metabolism by blocking the GSH and formation of reactive oxygen species\\n(ROS) in the tumor cells [69].\\nNanocarriers which are in early development are also identified in the analyzed studies. Uram et al. (2018, 2019)\\nproduced a biotinized 3\\u00aa generation PAMAM dendrimer for the carrying of a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-\\ngamma (PPAR\\u03b3) agonist Fmoc-L-Leucine along with CXB. Dendrimers are a particle type with notable pharmacological\\npotential and fast development evolution [34]. The nanoparticle of Uram et al. showed the inhibition of the growth of\\nglioblastoma cells [63, 72]. In the in vitro evaluation against skin cancers, there was more cytotoxicity to the fibroblasts\\ncell line (BJ) than against squamous cell carcinoma line (SCC-15), a factor attributed to the toxicity of the PPAR\\u03b3 agonist\\nand the lack of biotin receptors in the later cancer cell line [63]. In the later study, IC of formulation in the BJ cell line\\n50\\nwas of 1.29 \\u00b5M against 1.25 \\u00b5M in the glioblastoma U-118 MG cell line, showing high tumor cytotoxicity but worrying\\nresults against a healthy cell line. Lastly, a G3 dendrimer containing 31 subunits of CXB showed high cytotoxicity against\\nU-118 MG cells, but also possessed high cytotoxicity against Caenorhabditis elegans when compared with the CXB alone\\n[79]. Similar results were still found when co-loading with simvastatin and introduction of R-glycidol in the system [86].\\nAmong the nanocomposites, the complex formed by Wu et al., (2017) was capable of an efficient CXB and buthionine\\nsulfoximine delivery with a controlled pH-dependent release. The study showed a reversion of the chemotherapy resist-\\nance of the tested cancer cell lines, and a synergetic effect among the co-loaded drugs and an increase of the effect of\\nDOX applied in parallel.\\n3.5 Future perspectives in CXB\\u2011loaded nanocarriers\\nThe increase in in vivo tests published in the last 3 years of the analysis shows the possibility of clinical trials using CXB-\\nloaded nanocarriers in the current decade. The developed formulations revealed innovative approaches considering\\nthe surface modification of the systems used, the techniques for engineering the carriers, and the presence of other\\nsubstances within the CXB-loaded carriers.\\nOne of the main challenges to overcome the barriers of the clinical use of CXB in cancer therapy is its low water solubil-\\nity, an aspect cited in all the analyzed studies. In this sense, conventional nanocarriers, which already helped to enhance\\nother drugs properties (e.g.: Ambisome\\u00ae), may be able to overcome these drawbacks. However, different aspects also\\nhave to be considered for the feasibility of an innovative CXB-loaded nanocarrier. Thus, the main points we identified\\nin this review were (i) Quality-by-design approach looking at stability in blood and serum, site-specific targeting and\\nabsorption enhancers; and (ii) co-loading CXB with other drugs. Additionally, mechanisms that can induce controlled\\nrelease and/or provide diagnostic properties to the carriers received considerable attention. In this way, it is possible to\\ninfer that the CXB-loaded nanocarrier development process effectively can be guided by:\\n\\u2022 Careful selection of the raw materials used to produce the nanocarriers;\\n\\u2022 Choice of a drug with cross-action to the COX-2 dependent and independent mechanisms of the CXB, with preference\\nto another hydrophobic drug, in the way that the same encapsulation mechanisms can be explored;\\n\\u2022 Selection of materials that can ensure stability of the nanocarrier;\\n\\u2022 Selection of nanocarriers with stealth properties;\\n\\u2022 Selection of targeting ligands capable to enhance the nanocarrier entry into the tumor cells;\\n\\u2022 Selection of materials capable to promote a controlled release mechanism (e.g.: pH-dependent); and\\n\\u2022 Selection of materials able to provide images from their location site.\\nThe studies have shown that the constant introduction of new functionalities in the decades between 2010 and 2020\\nhas increased the size and complexity of drug delivery systems. While the continued advances in nanocarrier pattern-\\ning are commendable, there are concerns about the suitability of these systems for the industrial production required\\nfor clinical trials. While more complex systems are effective, they can be held back by the limitations of the technology\\nVol.:(0123456789)\\nReview Discover Nano (2024) 19:142 | https://doi.org/10.1186/s11671-024-04070-0\\navailable for scaling up laboratory formulations. The fact that, to our knowledge, there is no clinical trial with a CXB-\\nloaded nanocarrier can be partly attributed to this. Alongside, no complex in-vivo models were employed in the studies\\nreviewed in this paper, with a vast dominance of tumor-bearing mice of murine origin or xenografted from human cell\\nlines. As the relevance of the EPR effect has declined in some part due to the lack between murine models and clinical\\napplication, the advance in the models for the in vivo assays are essential to allow the newly fabricated formulations and/\\nor particles to meet the safety guarantees for clinical assays, regardless of the status of the CXB alone.\\nFinally, it must be acknowledged that the cytotoxic effect of CXB alone is often lower compared to conventional\\nanticancer protocols at feasible concentrations of the drug. However, this does not mean that the use of CXB for can-\\ncer chemotherapy is doomed to failure. It has been shown that the immunomodulation resulting from the inhibition\\nof COX-2 can induce a sensitization effect that enhances the effect of cytotoxic agents administered by co-loading\\nor other methods. This has opened in vivo perspectives for both established chemotherapeutic agents such as dox-\\norubin and novel pharmaceuticals and has even recently been cited in relation to postoperative immunomodulation\\n[94]. We believe that the pathway of immunomodulation by CXB, suitable in nanocarriers and in combination with\\nother cytotoxic agents, chemotherapies or not, is the most promising prospect for the clinical application of this\\ndrug in cancer protocols.\\n4 Conclusion\\nThe reports in the literature dealing with CXB-loaded nanocarriers in cancer therapy assume that these molecules\\nare an important alternative to increase the contribution of CXB against tumor growth. Although the research and\\ndevelopment of CXB-loaded nanocarriers is recent, the promising results are not limited to a specific type of nano-\\ncarrier or cancer. Among the major technical advances, effective prototypes developed in the last 3 years stand out.\\nThe combination of CXB with other anti-inflammatory drugs and/or apoptosis inducers seems pharmacologically\\npromising. The greatest advance to date from a clinical perspective is the ability of CXB to potentiate the cytotoxic\\neffects of established chemotherapeutic agents. The aspects identified and discussed in this review confirm the\\ngrowth of an emerging field based on the use of synergistic molecules supported by nanotechnology for the use of\\nconventional drugs in adjuvant cancer therapy.\\nAcknowledgements The authors thank CNPq (National Council for Scientific and Technological Development), FAPESB (Foundation for Research\\nSupport of the State of Bahia), PRPPG (Dean of Research/Pro Rectory of Research and Postgraduate Studies/Federal University of Bahia) and\\nCAPES (Coordination of Superior Level Staff Improvement).\\nAuthor contributions All authors contributed to the study conception and design.

      "The paper titled \"Advances, limitations and perspectives in the use of celecoxib-loaded nanocarriers in therapeutics of cancer\" provides a comprehensive review of the advancements in the development of nanocarriers for delivering celecoxib (CXB), a selective cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor, in cancer therapy. Here are the key findings and insights from the paper:\n",
      "\n",
      "### Summary of Findings\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Cancer and COX-2**: Cancer remains a significant global health challenge, with COX-2 being a critical enzyme associated with tumor progression. CXB has been used in adjuvant cancer therapy, but its clinical application is limited due to the need for high doses and associated cardiovascular risks (Santos et al., 2024).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Nanocarrier Development**: The review highlights the progress made in the last decade regarding CXB-loaded nanocarriers. These nanocarriers, which can be polymeric or lipid-based, enhance the biopharmaceutical properties of CXB, improving its solubility, stability, and targeted delivery (Santos et al., 2024).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Types of Nanocarriers**: Various formulations have been developed, including those based on poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA), liposomes, and hybrid nanoparticles. These formulations have shown promise in improving the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles of CXB (Santos et al., 2024).\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **In Vivo Studies**: The paper notes an increase in in vivo studies since 2017, indicating a shift towards more practical applications of CXB-loaded nanocarriers. However, most studies remain in preclinical phases, with no clinical trials reported yet (Santos et al., 2024).\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Targeting Mechanisms**: The review discusses various strategies for enhancing the targeting of CXB-loaded nanocarriers, including the use of surface ligands that can improve cellular uptake and specificity towards tumor cells (Santos et al., 2024).\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Synergistic Effects**: Combining CXB with other anti-inflammatory agents or apoptosis inducers has shown potential for enhancing therapeutic efficacy. The review emphasizes the importance of these combinations in overcoming drug resistance and improving treatment outcomes (Santos et al., 2024).\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Future Perspectives**: The authors suggest that future research should focus on optimizing the design of CXB-loaded nanocarriers, ensuring stability, and exploring the potential for clinical applications. They highlight the need for innovative approaches to enhance the therapeutic index of CXB in cancer treatment (Santos et al., 2024).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusion\n",
      "The paper concludes that CXB-loaded nanocarriers represent a promising avenue for improving cancer therapy. While significant advancements have been made, further research is needed to translate these findings into clinical practice effectively. The combination of CXB with other therapeutic agents and the development of more sophisticated nanocarrier systems could enhance the efficacy of cancer treatments (Santos et al., 2024).\n",

       "The paper titled \"Advances, limitations and perspectives in the use of celecoxib-loaded nanocarriers in therapeutics of cancer\" provides a comprehensive review of the advancements in the development of nanocarriers for delivering celecoxib (CXB), a selective cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor, in cancer therapy. Here are the key findings and insights from the paper:\n",
       "\n",
       "### Summary of Findings\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Cancer and COX-2**: Cancer remains a significant global health challenge, with COX-2 being a critical enzyme associated with tumor progression. CXB has been used in adjuvant cancer therapy, but its clinical application is limited due to the need for high doses and associated cardiovascular risks (Santos et al., 2024).\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Nanocarrier Development**: The review highlights the progress made in the last decade regarding CXB-loaded nanocarriers. These nanocarriers, which can be polymeric or lipid-based, enhance the biopharmaceutical properties of CXB, improving its solubility, stability, and targeted delivery (Santos et al., 2024).\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Types of Nanocarriers**: Various formulations have been developed, including those based on poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA), liposomes, and hybrid nanoparticles. These formulations have shown promise in improving the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles of CXB (Santos et al., 2024).\n",
       "\n",
       "4. **In Vivo Studies**: The paper notes an increase in in vivo studies since 2017, indicating a shift towards more practical applications of CXB-loaded nanocarriers. However, most studies remain in preclinical phases, with no clinical trials reported yet (Santos et al., 2024).\n",
       "\n",
       "5. **Targeting Mechanisms**: The review discusses various strategies for enhancing the targeting of CXB-loaded nanocarriers, including the use of surface ligands that can improve cellular uptake and specificity towards tumor cells (Santos et al., 2024).\n",
       "\n",
       "6. **Synergistic Effects**: Combining CXB with other anti-inflammatory agents or apoptosis inducers has shown potential for enhancing therapeutic efficacy. The review emphasizes the importance of these combinations in overcoming drug resistance and improving treatment outcomes (Santos et al., 2024).\n",
       "\n",
       "7. **Future Perspectives**: The authors suggest that future research should focus on optimizing the design of CXB-loaded nanocarriers, ensuring stability, and exploring the potential for clinical applications. They highlight the need for innovative approaches to enhance the therapeutic index of CXB in cancer treatment (Santos et al., 2024).\n",
       "\n",
       "### Conclusion\n",
       "The paper concludes that CXB-loaded nanocarriers represent a promising avenue for improving cancer therapy. While significant advancements have been made, further research is needed to translate these findings into clinical practice effectively. The combination of CXB with other therapeutic agents and the development of more sophisticated nanocarrier systems could enhance the efficacy of cancer treatments (Santos et al., 2024).\n",
